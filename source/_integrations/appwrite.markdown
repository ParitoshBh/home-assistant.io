With the **Appwrite** {% term integration %}, you can execute functions in your self-hosted Appwrite instance or their cloud offering.

The integration provides an action for each available function in the format `appwrite.<instance_id>_<function_id>` (function_id is slugified) which can be used to trigger a function. Multiple Appwrite instances are supported, but each must have a unique project ID in your Home Assistant configuration.

```

## Identifying New Functions

Since the integration doesn't actively poll, as such it'll not know on its own if new function is available. However, reloading the integration should automatically generate service for new function.

## Remove integration

This integration follows standard integration removal, no extra steps are required.
